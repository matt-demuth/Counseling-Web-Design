        <q>Krista is an amazing therapist! She's helped me through so many problems I felt I couldn't tell others. She's very warm,
        welcoming, and doesn't judge me. I highly recommend her!</q>

    <div class="mySlides">
        <q>We were dealing with a lot of anger from our 3 year old son. He was throwing massive tantrums when he didn’t get his
        way. He would kick, hit, bite, and spit on us. The tantrums would last for hours. We were at our wits end. Krista gave
        us really good advice for how to keep him rationale when we say triggers. It made a huge difference in his attitude and
        our relationship we rarely have tantrums now and when we do, it’s much less intense.</q>
